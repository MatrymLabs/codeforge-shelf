"""CARD: workflow -- a config-driven workflow engine on the pure FSM: roles and history.

A workflow is a lifecycle whose legal moves are a state machine (`parts/statemachine`) plus the
two things a bare FSM lacks: WHO may make each move (role gating) and a RECORD of what happened
(the history trail). One `WorkflowEngine` drives any workflow defined as data, so the SAME core
runs a game quest (`parts/quest`) and a business onboarding checklist (`parts/onboarding`) -- only
the adapter and the applied effects differ. Like the machine it wraps, it never renders and never
mutates world state: it steps a local `Instance` and names an effect for the caller to apply.

This is the first reusable vertical slice of the manufacturing vision (docs/vision_resync.md):
one part, proven in the game and reused in a practical application.
