"""CARD: retry -- retry with exponential backoff: transient failures recover, permanent ones don't.

A `RetryPolicy` decides how many times to try, which exceptions count as transient, and how long to
wait between tries (exponential backoff, capped). `run_with_retries` runs a callable under a policy:
it retries a transient failure, re-raises a permanent one immediately, and after the last attempt
re-raises the final failure (never swallowed). This is the standard retry/backoff pattern,
reimplemented from the concept (AWS Prescriptive Guidance, "retry with backoff") -- no code copied.

Framework-free and deterministic: the SLEEP is injected (default `time.sleep`), so tests pin the
exact backoff schedule and attempt count without waiting. It holds no I/O of its own. One core, two
lives: it auto-retries a flaky calibration in the game (`parts/calibrate`) and an unreliable API/DB
call in a practical app (`parts/resilient_call`).

Composes with the Hardware Store's `deadline` part: pass an optional `Deadline` to bound the TOTAL
wall-clock time of the retry loop, so a flaky call retries within a time budget, not just an attempt
count. When the budget is spent, retrying stops early and the last transient failure is re-raised.

Provenance: independently_implemented_pattern (retry/exponential-backoff; see
docs/hardware/retry-policy.yaml). No code copied.
