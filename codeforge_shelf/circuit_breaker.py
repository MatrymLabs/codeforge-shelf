"""CARD: circuit_breaker -- fail fast when a service is broken; test recovery after a timeout.

A circuit breaker guards calls to a flaky dependency. CLOSED, it passes calls and counts consecutive
failures; at a threshold it trips to OPEN and rejects calls immediately (no waiting on a dead
service). After a reset timeout it moves to HALF_OPEN and lets ONE probe through: success closes it,
failure opens it again. This is the standard circuit-breaker pattern (Azure resilience),
reimplemented from the concept -- no code copied.

Composition, not reinvention: the three-state lifecycle IS a state machine, so the breaker is built
ON the Hardware Store's own `state-machine` part (`parts/statemachine`); the breaker adds only the
failure counting and the timing that decide which transition fires. Framework-free and
deterministic: the clock is INJECTED (default `time.monotonic`). One core, two lives: it protects a
flaky relay in the game (`parts/relay`) and an unreliable upstream service in a practical app
(`parts/service_breaker`).

Provenance: independently_implemented_pattern (circuit breaker). No code copied.
